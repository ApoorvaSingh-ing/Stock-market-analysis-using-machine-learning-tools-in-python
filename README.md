Stock market analysis and prediction for Microsoft Cooperation using Machine Learning Tools in python.

Stock market analysis and prediction using machine learning tools has become increasingly popular in recent years. The use of these tools enables investors to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights. In this project, we aim to analyze and predict the stock market performance of Microsoft Corporation using machine learning algorithms in Python.

The project will involve the collection of historical stock market data for Microsoft Corporation and pre-processing of the data to remove noise and inconsistencies. We will then use exploratory data analysis techniques to identify patterns and trends in the data. Feature engineering techniques will be applied to extract relevant features that will help in predicting future stock prices.

We will employ various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks to build models that can predict future stock prices. We will evaluate the performance of these models using appropriate evaluation metrics and choose the best-performing model.

Finally, we will present our findings in the form of visualizations that will enable investors to make informed decisions based on our predictions. This project aims to provide insights into the stock market trends and risks associated with Microsoft Corporation's stock, and its outcomes can be used as a basis for further research and decision-making.
